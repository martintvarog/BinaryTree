/*! \defgroup tree Binary tree
 *  \brief The binary tree allows the storage of the data in the tree-like structure following one
 * simple rule. A tree node with a lower value goes to the left, otherwise, it goes right. With this
 * API this rule is implemented and it is valid even if some node is deleted from the structure.
